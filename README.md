- 👋 Hi, I’m @niloynew from Bangladesh
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their applications in different research fields.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning hands-on implementation of deep learning algorithms(e.g., RNN, CNN) in Python through google research collab tool.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects which apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the fields of healthcare and software repositories mining as well as cybersecurity.
- 📫 I am available at niloyroyantu@gmail.com
